### Windows
<details>
	<summary>Git</summary>

For version control; this is how we manage all the files on our app and how you are able to read this now on GitHub. You can download the latest version (2.31.0 as of March 2021) [here](https://git-scm.com/).
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Node</summary>
	
The runtime we use to build the app. Download the latest stable version (14.16.0 as of March 2021) [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Java 8 JDK</summary>
	
Used to build and emulate the app on Android Studio.
* To check your version open command prompt (*not* WSL) and run `java -version`, making sure that it is Java 8. If you don't have this version, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
* You will need to add **JAVA_HOME** as an environment variable, to tell Windows which version of Java you want to use. For a guide on how to do that, go [here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Python 3</summary>

Since the building system for React Native uses Python, you will need to install it. Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest stable version (3.9.2 as of March 2021).
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Android Studio</summary>

To build and test the app you can:
1. [Run on a physical *Android* device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device)
2. Run on Android Studio.  
	a. [Download](https://developer.android.com/studio) Android Studio.  
	b. Download the AVD (Android Virtual Device) inside Android Studio. Go [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) for an in-depth guide.

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Java 8 JDK (Optional)</summary>
	
Used to build and emulate the app on Android Studio, if you don't want to use XCode (or you want to use both), or want to see how the app looks on Android.
* To check your version open terminal and run `java -version`, making sure that it is Java 8. If you don't have this version, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
* You will need to add **JAVA_HOME**. For a guide on how to do that, go [here](https://dalanzg.github.io/tips-tutorials/posts/2016/03/21/how-to-set-java_home-on-mac-os-x/).
